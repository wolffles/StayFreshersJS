#USER STORIES
CURRENTLY ( rush to production )
  * fix profile not loading. on future page and err.response.data in actionActions.js
  * maybe have a static landing page.
  * stayfreshers home page should be different than landing page. when you click on the brand, takes you to how to use. future tab should be something else

CURRENTLY ( working on front end )
  * users need to be able to view others profiles
  * deck feed shouldn't have abiltiy to delete

After login a user is taken to profile dashboard page should have the ability to:
  - list decks by title and subject. ( done )
  - create, edit, and delete decks & cards ( done )
  - ability to view a profile
  - social aspect: add/delete friends, leave comments on decks view a friends deck
  - 
  - ability to test decks

  * its also what you do with it. if you use some apis, and make something flashy anything can be impressive. Like a drag and drop matching system, or having a file uploader where a text file can be converted into a deck
